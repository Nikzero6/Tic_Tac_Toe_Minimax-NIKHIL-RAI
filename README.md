# Tic_Tac_Toe_Minimax-NIKHIL-RAI
- It is an AI tic-tac-toe which always plays a perfect game, at best an experienced player can tie with the computer but will never win because the game will be already solved in the program. 
- For the selection of optimal move the use of minimax algorithm in game theory and calculation of evaluation function has been applied.


### Development tools and Programming language:
HTML is used to write the basic skeleton and CSS for styling and JavaScript for client side changes and decision making.

### Approach:
1. Creating Skeleton html and CSS.
2. Storing the board positions in the form of array.
3. Creating a draw function to draw board depending upon the player playing and move position.
4. Creating a minimax function to find the next optimal move depending upon board current state (basically it calculates a bestScore using the evaluation function).
5. Creating a mousePressed function to make the board responsive to mouse click.
6. Creating a checkWinner function to check for a winner based on all possible wins (horizontal, vertical and diagonal).
